Individually Designed Nutrition  
Given proper nutrition, the human body has an amazing ability to repair itself. To do so, individuals need to take high quality nutritional supplements in the proper dosage. Nutritional supplements provide our bodies with the vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients we are not getting from "manufactured" processed foods or from the nutrient depleted fruits and vegetables that are from distant lands.

EveryBODY has nutritional needs unique to them, unlike any other Individual...specific nutritional depletions from lifestyle, medications, health issues, diet, geographical climate...on and on goes the list of considerations, based on what can seem to be an overwhelming number of factors. All of this, combined with an individuals desired outcomes and the enormous amount of scientific evidence that is changing daily as new discoveries are published, makes finding the right products to meet each of our unique nutritional needs a seemingly impossible task.

INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED NUTRITION (aka IDnutrition) has made it all possible, by using more than 4,000 algorithms, which when combined with an Individual's unique profile, yields more than 4 million potential nutritional programs, making Individual Design Nutrition a program that is truly Designed for the Individual.

New science confirms that drugs and nutrients work better and produce more desired effects when given at very specific times of the day. Enhance International also add Active fillers to our nutrients, so what would be inactive inert filler in other company's tablets and capsules we turn into an opportunity to bring you more quality ingredients by adding bioactive "filler" that your body can benefit from.

In addition to understanding the value of high quality ingredients and proper dosing, at ID Nutrition we also believe that time matters and apply ChronoTherapy to all our product formulas. We understand the importance of optimal dosing at the right time of day by taking into account the 24 hour biological rhythms of the body.

Our formulas are manufactured under our Pharmacist's strict controls and specifications using pharmaceutical grade nutritionals exclusively.
